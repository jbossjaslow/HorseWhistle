# Horse Whistle Mod for Minecraft 1.20.1

This mod adds a horse whistle item. When used on your tamed horse, it registers that horse to the whistle. Then, you can right click again to summon your horse to you. If you wish to disconnect this item from the horse, simply crouch+right click. This item can be enchanted!

**Note: your horse must be in a loaded chunk to be teleported. This is a limitation imposed by Minecraft**

The durability of the whistle and the distance your horse can teleport are both exposed as config options in the config file. This has ModMenu interaction as well.

This is my first mod, I'd love feedback. Feel free to reach out with questions or comments!
